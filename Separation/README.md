Two tools:

Orthogroup_Counts/orthogroup_category_counts.py:
Python script that returns numbers of orthogroups per catefory for each species


Orthogroup_Names/proteinID_orthogroups.py:
Python script that returns each protein id with its orthogroup, category, and portal (portal  group   og      id)

Both tools require that they are in the same directory(results/Orthogroups/) to access files: Orthogroups_UnassignedGenes.tsv and Orthogroups.tsv

*** OrthoFinder must have been run with file names appended with [filename].P or [filename].NP for these tools to recognize pathogenic/non-pathogenic species
